Oftentimes a **sitemap** or **user flow** illustrates the primary and alternate paths your users can take through your website, based on their goals.

In order to bring this user flow to life, we'll need to build out a **navigation bar**. A navigation bar is a section on a website that links to other parts of the site. You'll use the `<nav></nav>` elements to define a set of navigation links. You can make your navigation appear either vertically, horizontally, or as an alternatively styled block.

Before we get started, look at the code to get familiar with how you'd add a nav bar to your site!
